Welcome to my own dotfile repository!

For the purpose of safe storage/backup as well as sharing,
I have placed all my relevant dotfiles in a local (git) 
repository folder called .mydotfiles  . Next, I have
immediately created a symbolic link by 

e.g.  ln -s .mydotfiles/.bash_profile .bash_profile

so that (a link to) each dotfile was accessbile from ~/

Enjoy!
Michele
